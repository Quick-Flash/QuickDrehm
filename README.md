# QuickDrehm

A heavily modified fork of dRehmFlight that offers flight performance improvements. Adds RPM filtering, and dynamic notch filtering.

## Overview

QuickDrehm is the flight controller for hobbyists, hackers, and non-coders interested in stabilizing their wacky and unique flying creations. The code and supporting documentation is built to bring someone up to speed on VTOL flight stabilization concepts as quickly and painlessly as possible. The code is written and presented in a way that is intuitive, and easy to follow. No more digging through countless folders and confusing classes just to add an 'if' statement for your custom drone application. This flight controller uses a Teensy 4.0 microcontroller, so there is no confusing flashing or compiling process necessary. If you can use Arduino, you can start expanding the capabilites of this flight controller to your liking.

QuickDrehm has been used as a teaching tool for aircraft stabilization and flight control principles at Utah State University. It is meant to out-perform dRehmFlight with a small amount of added complexity. It is not menat to be used in a commercial sense. It is best suited for rapid prototyping or allowing radio control hobbyists and students get their feet wet in flight control code for their fixed wing, multirotor, or VTOL project. More information to come.

This code is entirely free to use and will stay that way forever. If you found this helpful for your project, donations are appreciated: [Paypal Donation](https://www.paypal.me/NicholasRehm)

### Hardware Requirements
This flight controller is based off of the Teensy 4.0 microcontroller and MPU6050 6DOF IMU. The following components (available on Amazon) are required to complete the flight controller assembly:


**Teensy 4.0**: https://amzn.to/3oFG3QN

**Alternative Links**: [Sparkfun](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15583), [Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4323), [Electromaker](https://www.electromaker.io/shop/product/teensy-40?gclid=Cj0KCQjwxIOXBhCrARIsAL1QFCYcZsU4tRXVgeqfOOJyg_zPV2MXTeJM2QwJ6zafMTsCb6MjWthk7r8aAn6hEALw_wcB)

Due to supply chain issues, the Teensy 4.0 has been frequently out of stock throughout 2022. The Teensy 4.1 is generally in stock more often and is immediately compatible with the dRehmFlight pin mappings (plus you get extra bonus pins!): https://amzn.to/3c1OSSw


**GY-521 MPU6050 IMU**: https://amzn.to/3edF1Vn

### Software Requirments
Code is uploaded to the board using the Arduino IDE; download the latest version here: https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/software

To connect to the Teensy, you must also download and install the Teensyduino arduino add-on; download and instructions available here: https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/td_download.html

Additionally to get the Teensy4.0 to function it must be overclocked to 816mhz (it appears to be a bug and I'd happily accept a PR to fix it).

Set the optimization to fastest to give yourself the most headroom with your code.
